# 1. Determination of Wavelength of Laser Source

## Name: M.Gokul
## Reg No: 24000042

## AIM:
To determine the wavelength of the given laser source of light.  

## APPARATUS REQUIRED:  
Semiconductor diode laser, grating (2500 lines/ inch), screen, metre scale.  

## FORMULA:  
Wave length of the given laser source of light  

λ= 
nN/
sinθ

### Where,   
n – Order of diffraction  
λ – Wavelength of Laser light (metre)  
D – Angle of diffraction (degree)  
xₙ – Number of ruling lines in grating (lines/m)  

### PROCEDURE  
• To determine the wavelength of the given laser source, He – Ne laser is switched on and the laser beam is passed through the grating.  

• The diffracted rays are collected on a screen. In the diffraction pattern, the circular spot at the centre and the other orders on either side of the spot is observed on the transparent scale.  

• The distance between the central spot and first order is measured and tabulated.  

• The distance between the grating and screen D is also measured.  

• The wave length of the given laser source is determined by using the formula,  
λ= 
nN/
sinθ
